# Lore Overview

The Bushido anime follows an ambitious entrepreneur who discovers a mysterious artifact capable of scanning hidden regions of Japan. When he activates it, he is transported to 16th‑century Japan and thrust into a conflict among eight clans. Each clan embodies one of the Bushido virtues: Courage, Loyalty, Compassion, Respect, Integrity, Honor, Duty, and a final clan twisted by the antagonist.

The protagonist must learn these virtues to overcome his own hubris and stop his malevolent doppelgänger from corrupting the clans. Over what feels like decades, he grows through trials of bravery, betrayal and self‑sacrifice. In the finale he defeats the doppelgänger only to awaken and realize the ordeal was a hyper‑advanced simulation designed to test his moral worth.

## Clan Leaders
- **Courage Clan Leader:** stern and honorable, testing the hero's bravery
- **Loyalty Clan Leader:** trusting but challenged by betrayal within the clan
- **Compassion Clan Leader:** a pacifist ruler torn by war
- **Respect Clan Leader:** traditional and rigid
- **Integrity Clan Leader:** faces deception and corruption
- **Honor Clan Leader:** pivotal in rallying the clans
- **Duty Clan Leader:** disciplined and strategic

The antagonist seeks to control the artifact and twist the virtues for power.
